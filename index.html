                <strong><span style="font-family:'Rochester', cursive;">Hello!</span> My name is Rebeacca
                    Modayil and I am a web developer!</strong>
            </span>
            <br><br>
            If you met me about 6 months ago, I would have never imagined introducing myself as a web developer. I
            spent the last 4 years at Temple University pursuing a marketing degree because I wanted a career that
            allowed me to be creative, innovative, and to think outside the box. I gained lots of experience
            through internships and freelance work which helped me grow as a young professional. However, it didn’t dawn
            to
            me until my senior year of college that I really enjoyed the digital side of marketing. Interning as a
            National Digital Marketer with Subaru of America gave me the opportunity to work with web developers to
            fix bugs and manage web content that contributed to a flawless user experience. Towards my final
            semester, I started my job search to kick off my career, but to be honest, many of the marketing roles I
            found didn't really have the qualities I was looking for.
            <br><br>
            That’s when I decided to turn to web development. It was a few weeks before graduation when I decided to
            enroll in University of Pennsylvania’s Coding Bootcamp. It was a risky decision, but — boy oh boy — I am
            glad I took the chance! Learning full stack development opened my eyes to the possibilities of what one
            can create with just a few lines of code <i>(I particularly enjoy front-end design)</i>.
            I am excited to see what the future entails as I continue to perfect my craft!
